# Test File Creation - UPDATED

This file verifies that our file creation system is working properly.

## Issues Fixed:

### Issue 1: Files Directory Not Visible

- **FIXED**: Default `home/project/` directory structure now created automatically
- **FIXED**: Files created through AI actions appear in the file tree correctly

### Issue 2: Code Blocks Instead of Actual Files

- **FIXED**: AI now creates actual .py/.java files instead of markdown code blocks
- **FIXED**: Content cleanup removes markdown code block markers
- **FIXED**: Proper code formatting and indentation preserved
- **NEW FIX**: Enhanced content cleaning to handle various markdown patterns
- **NEW FIX**: Added validation to ensure content is not empty after cleanup

### Issue 3: Files Disappear When Clicked

- **FIXED**: Improved file selection logic with better error handling
- **FIXED**: Enhanced debugging to track file state changes
- **FIXED**: Better path normalization for file selection

### Issue 4: Incomplete Prompts File

- **NEW FIX**: Fixed prompts.ts file that was ending with incomplete code blocks ("```")
- **NEW FIX**: Added comprehensive file creation rules to system prompt
- **NEW FIX**: Enhanced instructions to prevent duplicate content

### Issue 5: Duplicate File Content

- **NEW FIX**: Added enhanced logging to track file content during creation
- **NEW FIX**: Improved content verification in action runner
- **NEW FIX**: Enhanced debug utilities to detect duplicate content

## Testing Commands

Try these prompts to test the fixes:

1. **Python Test**: "write a hello world python app"

   - Should create `hello.py` file in the file tree
   - File should contain properly formatted Python code (no markdown)
   - Clicking on the file should open it in the editor

2. **Java Test**: "create a simple java program"

   - Should create `HelloWorld.java` file
   - File should contain properly formatted Java code
   - Should be clickable and editable

3. **Calculator Test**: "make a calculator in python"

   - Should create a proper Python calculator script
   - Multiple files may be created if needed
   - All files should be visible and accessible

4. **Multi-File Test**: "create 3 different python files: one for math operations, one for string operations, and one for file operations"
   - Should create 3 separate .py files with unique, distinct content
   - Each file should have different functionality as requested
   - No duplicate content between files

## Debug Tools

If you encounter issues, open browser console and run:

```javascript
debugFileState();
```

This will show:

- Available files in the store
- Currently selected file
- Current document state
- Full file store contents
- **NEW**: Content analysis to detect duplicate file content
- **NEW**: Enhanced file content debugging

## Expected Behavior Now:

✅ **File Directory**: `home/project/` folder visible by default
✅ **Python Support**: Creates actual `.py` files with proper formatting
✅ **Java Support**: Creates actual `.java` files with proper formatting  
✅ **File Visibility**: All created files appear in left sidebar file tree
✅ **File Selection**: Clicking files opens them in editor (doesn't disappear)
✅ **Content Uniqueness**: Each file has unique content as requested
✅ **No Markdown**: Files contain clean code without markdown formatting
✅ **Proper Cleanup**: Enhanced content cleaning handles all markdown patterns

## Latest Changes Made:

1. **Fixed prompts.ts**: Removed incomplete code blocks and added comprehensive file creation rules
2. **Enhanced Action Runner**: Better content cleaning and validation with detailed logging
3. **Improved Debug Tools**: Added duplicate content detection capabilities
4. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced file creation error reporting and validation
   ✅ **Code Quality**: No markdown code blocks, proper indentation preserved

## Known Working Commands:

- "write a hello world python app"
- "create a simple java program"
- "make a calculator in python"
- "build a simple web page with HTML and CSS"
- "create a todo app in javascript"

All should create actual files with proper code formatting!
